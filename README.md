# MineSim-Dynamic

Scenario Library and Benchmark for Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance Planning in Open-Pit Mines.

This library focuses on testing obstacle avoidance in mixed traffic at mining intersections. Its scenarios feature unstructured intersections with varying slopes and irregular shapes, where autonomous mining trucks interact with other vehicles. The main goal is to assess the trucksâ€™ smooth obstacle avoidance.

## :fire: TODO

- [x] Initialize MineSim-Dynamic repository, 2024.12.20;
- [x] Update repository documentation, 2025.01.23;
- [ ] Release full codebase (TBD);

## Dynamic Obstacle Planning Task in MineSim

The dynamic obstacle avoidance planning problem is first defined for each scenario. A complete test task includes the vehicle parameters, the ego vehicle's state update model, the initial states, the target states, and the other agents' state update policy. As shown in Figure below, the ego vehicle's reference point is the rear axle center, with the initial state (denoted as ${{\bf{x}}_0} = [{x_0},{y_0},{\theta _0},{v_0}{\rm{,}}{\gamma _0},{a_0},{\delta _0}]$, representing x and y positions, yaw, speed, yaw rate, acceleration, and front wheel steering angle) indicated by a yellow arrow. The target area, marked by an orange polygon, represents the region the vehicle must navigate to complete the task.

## Benchmark Algorithms in MineSim

For the obstacle avoidance problem in scenarios with dynamic obstacles, we provide three benchmark algorithms:

- IDM, rule-based longitudinal Intelligent Driving Model (IDM) [1].
- FOP, Frenet-based Optimal Planner (FOP) [2].
- SPMM, Sampling Planner using Predefined Maneuver Modes (SPPMM) [3].The SPPMM algorithm is an improvement of the FOP.
